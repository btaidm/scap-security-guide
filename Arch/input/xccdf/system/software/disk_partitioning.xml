		Disk Partitioning
	</title>
	<description>
		To ensure separation and protection of data, there
		are top-level system directories which should be placed on their
		own physical partition or logical volume. The installer's default
		partitioning scheme creates separate logical volumes for 
		<tt>/</tt>, <tt>/boot</tt>, and <tt>swap</tt>.
		<ul>
		<li>If starting with any of the default layouts, check the box to
		"Review and modify partitioning." This allows for the easy creation
		of additional logical volumes inside the volume group already
		created, though it may require making <tt>/</tt>'s logical volume smaller to
		create space. In general, using logical volumes is preferable to
		using partitions because they can be more easily adjusted
		later.</li>
		<li>If creating a custom layout, create the partitions mentioned in
		the previous paragraph (which the installer will require anyway),
		as well as separate ones described in the following sections.</li>
		</ul>
		If a system has already been installed, and the default
		partitioning scheme was used, it is possible but nontrivial to
		modify it to create separate logical volumes for the directories
		listed above. The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) makes this possible.
		See the LVM HOWTO at <weblink-macro link="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/"/>
		for more detailed information on LVM.

		<title>Ensure /var Located On Separate Partition</title>
		<description>
			The <tt>/var</tt> directory is used by daemons and other system
			services to store frequently-changing data. Ensure that <tt>/var</tt> has its own partition
			or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.

		<rationale>
			Ensuring that <tt>/var</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the
			setting of more restrictive mount options. This helps protect
			system services such as daemons or other programs which use it.
			It is not uncommon for the <tt>/var</tt> directory to contain
			world-writable directories installed by other software packages.
