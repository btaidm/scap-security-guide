<title>DISA STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (ported to Arch Linux)</title>
<description>
This profile contains configuration checks that align to the 
DISA STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux V1R1.

In addition to being applicable to RHEL7, DISA recognizes this 
configuration baseline as applicable to the operating system
tier of Red Hat technologies that are based off RHEL7, such as RHEL
Server,  RHV-H, RHEL for HPC, RHEL Workstation, and Red Hat 
Storage deployments.

This is the beginning of the port for Arch Linux based on the DISA STIG for RHEL7
